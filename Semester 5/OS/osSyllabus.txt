OS SYLLABUS:

	-Threads 		[x]
	-Synchronization 	[x]
	-Deadlocks 		[x]
	-Main Memory 		[x]
	-virtual Memory 	[x]
	-page faults 		[x]


how to prepare:
I know threads, page faults, some of memory. I need more focus on synchronization.
I'll start with numerical type questions, then I'll progress towards synchronization.
